# Qodana project model

Last updated: 2026-10-03.

## Canonical roots

- Repository root: `.`.
- Backend solution: `Coglatas.slnx`.
- Backend projects:
  - `src/Coglatas.Domain/Coglatas.Domain.csproj`
  - `src/Coglatas.Application/Coglatas.Application.csproj`
  - `src/Coglatas.Infrastructure/Coglatas.Infrastructure.csproj`
  - `src/Coglatas.Web/Coglatas.Web.csproj`
  - `tests/Coglatas.Tests/Coglatas.Tests.csproj`
- Active Angular workspace: `frontend/`.
- Legacy Angular scaffold: `coglatas-frontend/`; it is inactive and excluded from Qodana analysis.

## Required toolchain

- .NET SDK: `10.0.402`, pinned by `global.json` with roll-forward disabled.
- Target framework: `net10.0`.
- Node.js: `24.x` for the SARIF/project-model guard.
- Qodana action: `JetBrains/qodana-action` v2026.2.2, pinned by SHA in the trusted workflows.
- Community linter image: `jetbrains/qodana-cdnet:2026.2-privileged@sha256:21bbbfeac0e61fe8790cc27d5754b87d57b8032c0c32f84ddeb887027f83ec4f`.
- Reusable Qodana gate: `.github/workflows/qodana_trusted_gate.yml`, invoked locally by the trusted Community caller.

Qodana Community for .NET is intentionally the .NET lane. Frontend policy is enforced independently by SonarQube Cloud, ESLint/angular-eslint and Stylelint, so the Qodana bootstrap sets `QODANA_SKIP_FRONTEND_BOOTSTRAP=true` in CI instead of spending Community-linter time building an unsupported frontend analysis surface.

## Inspection policy

`qodana.yaml` starts from `qodana.recommended` and additionally enables every inspection whose default JetBrains IDE severity is:

- `ERROR`
- `WARNING`
- `WEAK WARNING`

This keeps the profile deliberately strict while avoiding the previous unrestricted `ALL` inventory, which also enabled low-value typo/information-only inspections and could add substantial noise and scan cost.

Repository-wide duplication analysis is also enabled explicitly with JetBrains inspection IDs `DuplicatedCode` and `DuplicatedStatements`. Keeping these inspections explicit prevents a future change to the recommended profile or default severity from silently removing duplication coverage. Their SARIF findings flow through the same per-inspection debt ratchet as every other Qodana rule: historical findings may be recorded as a reviewed baseline, while any count above that baseline fails the gate.

Generated output, dependencies, runtime data, test artifacts and the inactive legacy frontend remain excluded. First-party backend source and tests remain in scope.

## Solution and configuration

The canonical .NET project model is configured in `qodana.yaml`:

```yaml
dotnet:
  solution: Coglatas.slnx
  configuration: Release
```

Keeping these values in `qodana.yaml` makes local Docker runs and GitHub Actions consume the same solution/configuration instead of duplicating command-line flags.

## Bootstrap sequence

Qodana runs `scripts/quality/qodana-bootstrap.sh` before inspections. For the Community .NET CI lane the script:

1. Reads the required SDK from `global.json`.
2. Installs that exact SDK if the image does not provide it.
3. Prints the active SDK/MSBuild information.
4. Runs `dotnet restore Coglatas.slnx --verbosity normal` for the Qodana execution environment.
5. On main artifact-hub runs, verifies and reuses the exact-SHA prebuilt `bin/obj` tree and skips compilation; on standalone/manual fallback runs, executes `dotnet build Coglatas.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore`.
6. Skips the frontend bootstrap because `qodana-cdnet` does not analyze the active Angular/TypeScript application.

Restore, build, SDK, package-resolution, solution-load and project-model failures are hard failures.

## Trusted Community quality gate

Main pushes invoke the tokenless Community lane from `.github/workflows/main-build-artifacts.yml`, after the trusted main .NET build artifact is available. `.github/workflows/qodana_code_quality.yml` remains a manual fallback caller and delegates analysis to the same local reusable workflow `qodana_trusted_gate.yml`. Pull-request JetBrains analysis is handled separately by the ReSharper InspectCode fast lane, so Qodana no longer spends the PR feedback budget on full-repository inspection.

On the main artifact-hub path, the Community lane restores the exact-SHA `bin/obj` outputs, performs NuGet restore for the Qodana environment, skips duplicate bootstrap compilation, and then performs the repository-wide Qodana scan with the canonical `qodana.yaml` project model and the reviewed per-inspection debt ratchet. `check-qodana-project-model.mjs` compares current inspection counts with `scripts/quality/qodana-rule-baseline.json`; any count above its reviewed budget fails, while Critical findings, unresolved-symbol findings, project-model failures, missing/invalid SARIF, and Qodana execution failures remain hard failures.

The lane keeps repository permissions at `contents: read`, does not publish quick fixes or modify repository contents, and does not receive `QODANA_TOKEN`. Qodana Cloud publication is intentionally separated into the trusted Cloud workflow described below.

## Full-repository quality gate and Qodana Cloud

Main-push Cloud publication is the protected `qodana-cloud` job inside `.github/workflows/main-build-artifacts.yml`. It restores the same exact-SHA .NET build outputs used by the other main consumers, performs only the environment-local NuGet restore, then runs full repository analysis with `pr-mode: false`. The job is bound to `syncfusion-licensed-build`, receives `QODANA_TOKEN` there, and publishes the report to Qodana Cloud.

`.github/workflows/qodana_cloud_quality.yml` remains a manual-only fallback for trusted `main`. It performs normal local build preparation instead of consuming the main artifact hub. The former weekly schedule is currently disabled to reduce CI consumption.

Because repository publication policy requires every secret-bearing job to use a static protected environment, the Cloud job is bound to the repository's existing `syncfusion-licensed-build` protected environment. Qodana does not consume the Syncfusion secret; the environment is reused solely as the already-established trusted secret boundary. A dedicated Qodana environment may replace it later if one is created with equivalent protection.

The Cloud lane fails before Qodana starts if `QODANA_TOKEN` is empty. The token must be available to the job as the Qodana Cloud project token for this repository. This prevents a green trusted run from silently producing only a local/GitHub report while Qodana Cloud receives nothing.

Keeping Cloud publication exclusively in protected main/manual jobs with no PR trigger is deliberate: Qodana Cloud credentials never enter the pull-request trust boundary, while the ReSharper PR lane remains unprivileged.

The repository currently has historical non-critical Qodana debt. The baseline captured from main commit `c6aedb95c8780a5e8fac42b7b96ecccf80f1ad80` contains 3,479 findings. Instead of accepting unlimited historical debt or requiring an immediate zero-warning migration, the SARIF guard uses a per-inspection ratchet while preserving the full report:

- Critical findings: `0` allowed.
- Unresolved-symbol findings: `0` allowed.
- Files affected by unresolved-symbol findings: `0` allowed.
- Project-model/restore/build/SDK/package-resolution failures: `0` allowed.
- Missing or invalid SARIF: hard failure.
- Qodana process failure: hard failure.
- Missing `QODANA_TOKEN` on a trusted Cloud run: hard failure.
- Any inspection count above `scripts/quality/qodana-rule-baseline.json`: hard failure.
- A newly appearing inspection ID has an implicit baseline of zero and therefore fails until the underlying issue is fixed or an explicitly reviewed baseline increase is approved.

The largest baseline buckets at introduction are `NotAccessedPositionalProperty.Global` (1,173), `PropertyCanBeMadeInitOnly.Global` (595), `InconsistentNaming` (154), `MergeIntoPattern` (150), `UnusedMember.Global` (142), `MemberCanBePrivate.Local` (140), and `AccessToDisposedClosure` (121).

Debt reduction is ordered by risk rather than raw count: fix lifetime/disposal, nullability, short-lived HTTP clients and multiple-enumeration findings first; then apply mechanical cleanup; finally audit DTO/record positional-property and naming findings where serialization, OpenAPI, EF, or other public contracts may make apparently-unused members intentional.

Use `scripts/quality/write-qodana-rule-baseline.mjs` after a successful scan to generate a lower candidate baseline. By default the generator refuses to increase any rule budget; `QODANA_ALLOW_BASELINE_INCREASE=1` is required for an intentional increase so that it is visible in review.

All non-critical findings remain visible in the GitHub Actions inventory artifact, and trusted Cloud runs publish the full-repository result to Qodana Cloud. The existing tokenless full-repository lane remains in place for compatibility with the established immutable gate and repository policy; the Cloud lane adds publication without expanding the PR secret boundary.

## Exclusion rationale

Qodana analyzes first-party source and tests, but not generated output, dependencies, runtime data or inactive source.

Configured exclusions include:

- `**/bin/**`, `**/obj/**`: build/compiler output.
- `**/node_modules/**`: external npm dependencies.
- `**/dist/**`, `**/.angular/**`, `**/storybook-static/**`: frontend generated output/cache.
- `**/coverage/**`, `**/TestResults/**`, `**/test-results/**`, `**/playwright-report/**`, `**/.playwright/**`: test/browser output.
- `**/.qodana/**`, `.tmp`, `**/artifacts/**`: scanner and CI/local artifacts.
- `src/Coglatas.Web/wwwroot`: hosted frontend build output; source of truth is `frontend/`.
- `src/Coglatas.Web/data`: local runtime data.
- `coglatas-frontend`: inactive legacy frontend scaffold.

Tests are not excluded.
