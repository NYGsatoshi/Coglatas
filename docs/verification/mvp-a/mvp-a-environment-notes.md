# MVP-A Environment Notes

Verification date: 2026-06-24

## A-01 Windows Baseline Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Evidence files:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-01-build-test-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-01-baseline-failure-log.md`

Observed local host:

| Item | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Windows 10.0.26200, win-x64 |
| .NET SDK | 10.0.301 |
| .NET runtime | Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.9, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.9 |
| global.json | Present, pins 10.0.301 |
| Docker | Client 29.5.3 installed; Docker Desktop Linux engine unavailable |
| Docker Compose | v5.1.4 |
| Node.js | v26.4.0 |
| npm | 11.17.0 through `npm.cmd`; `npm.ps1` blocked by PowerShell execution policy |

The 2026-06-28 .NET baseline passed restore, Release build, and the backend test runner. Docker runtime evidence, root UI tests, and live PostgreSQL assertions remain blocked or Needs verification as recorded in the A-01 evidence files. No secret values were copied into the evidence.

## A-02 Windows Health Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Evidence files:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-02-health-check-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-02-health-check-failure-log.md`

Observed local host:

| Item | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Windows NT 10.0.26200.0, win-x64 |
| .NET SDK | 10.0.301 |
| .NET runtime | Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.9, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.9 |
| Docker | Client 29.5.3 installed; Docker Desktop Linux engine unavailable |
| Docker Compose | v5.1.4 |
| Local app URL | `http://localhost:5098` from launch profile |

The app process started and `/health/live` returned 200, but `/health/ready` returned 503. Local PostgreSQL on port 5432 was not reachable and Docker Compose container health could not be inspected. This A-02 refresh is Blocked; it does not imply production approval.

## A-03 Application Smoke Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Evidence files:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-03-application-smoke-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-03-smoke-failure-log.md`

| Branch | `main` |
| Commit | `d20589a6d237e3c7c0fbbefb8040861bfd4b7506` |
| OS | Windows 10.0.26200, win-x64 |
| .NET SDK | 10.0.301 |
| .NET runtime | Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.9, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.9 |
| Docker client | 29.5.3 |
| Docker Compose | v5.1.4 |
| Node.js | v26.4.0 |
| npm | 11.17.0 through `npm.cmd` |
| Smoke base URL | `http://127.0.0.1:18083` |

The app process started, root and SPA shell routes returned 200, `/health/live` returned 200, public auth status was safe, unsafe anonymous POSTs without CSRF returned 403, and protected anonymous APIs returned 401. `/health/ready`, Docker runtime, PostgreSQL runtime, frontend Angular/Storybook builds, root Playwright UI tests, and authenticated admin/non-admin/tenant smoke checks remain blocked or need verification as recorded in the A-03 evidence files. No secret values, CSRF token values, cookies, connection strings, tenant identifiers, or personal data were copied into the evidence.

## A-04 AuthZ Boundary Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Evidence files:

| Commit | `e013561b04b8a15c239e5d04663c5b71ffa7a0cd` |
| OS | Windows 10.0.26200, win-x64 |
| .NET SDK | 10.0.301 |
| .NET runtime | Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.9, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.9 |
| Docker client | 29.5.3 |
| Docker Compose | v5.1.4 |
| Docker daemon | Unavailable on `npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine` |
| PostgreSQL local port 5432 | TCP connection failed |

The A-04 backend verification pass fixed a test-harness Data Protection key-path issue and then passed focused auth security tests, focused tenant isolation tests, and the full backend suite. Docker runtime and local PostgreSQL remained unavailable, and fresh-runtime authenticated admin/non-admin/tenant smoke remains blocked by the baseline identity/bootstrap gap. No secret values, CSRF token values, cookies, connection strings, tenant identifiers, or personal data were copied into the evidence.

## A-07 File Boundary Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-29

Evidence files:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-07-file-boundary-baseline.md`

| .NET SDK | 10.0.301 |
| .NET runtime | Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.9, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.9 |
| Docker client | 29.5.3 |
| Docker Compose | v5.1.4 |
| Docker runtime | Not verified in this pass; Docker emitted a local config access warning |
| Test data | Synthetic in-memory tenants, users, projects, tasks, files, and attachments only |

The A-07 backend verification pass fixed file/artifact response storage identifier exposure, added private no-store download headers, added metadata-only denied file-access audit logging, passed a targeted file/storage/tenant-boundary test slice at 32/32, and passed the full backend suite at 134/134. Fresh-runtime authenticated file smoke remains blocked by the baseline identity/bootstrap gap, and attachment/conversation actor matrix, explicit grant/revoked-grant behavior, object storage/signed URL behavior, live PostgreSQL, and container runtime evidence remain Needs verification or Blocked. No real file bodies, raw secrets, token values, cookies, connection strings, signed URLs, tenant identifiers, or personal data were copied into the evidence.

## A-08 Communication Boundary Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-29

Evidence files:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-08-communication-boundary-baseline.md`

| OS | Windows 10.0.26200, win-x64 |
| .NET SDK | 10.0.301 |
| .NET runtime | Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.9, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.9 |
| Docker client | 29.5.3 |
| Docker Compose | v5.1.4 |
| Docker runtime | Not verified in this pass; Docker emitted a local config access warning |
| Test data | Synthetic in-memory tenants, users, conversations, messages, notifications, and read state only |

The A-08 backend verification pass fixed removed-participant message mutation, cross-conversation read cursor, and private message notification-body risks in the communication service path. It passed a focused HTTP tenant and communication-boundary test slice at 11/11 and the full backend suite at 138/138. Fresh-runtime authenticated communication smoke remains blocked by the baseline identity/bootstrap gap, and same-tenant DM actor matrix, admin/teacher policy, thread coverage, realtime/polling coverage, live audit/log review, live PostgreSQL, and container runtime evidence remain Needs verification or Blocked. No real message bodies, raw secrets, token values, cookies, session identifiers, connection strings, tenant identifiers, or personal data were copied into the evidence.

## Local Environment

| Item | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04 container |
| .NET SDK | 10.0.200 |
| .NET runtime | Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.4, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.4 |
| global.json | Missing |
| Docker | 29.3.0-1 |
| Docker Compose | v2.40.3 |
| Node.js | v24.14.0 |
| npm | 11.9.0 |
| Local .NET tool manifest | `.config/dotnet-tools.json`, `dotnet-ef` 10.0.8 |

## Database Setup Used

Local PostgreSQL was started with:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose/dev/local.yml up -d postgres
```

The container became healthy as `coglatas-postgres-1` on port `5432`.

Two local databases were used:

| Database | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `coglatas` | Main local verification database, also used for targeted PostgreSQL integration tests. |
| `coglatas_mvpa_fresh` | Fresh non-destructive verification database created to confirm startup seed behavior. |

No destructive database reset/drop command was run.

## Runtime Notes

`dotnet run --project src/Coglatas.Web --configuration Release --no-build` used `src/Coglatas.Web/Properties/launchSettings.json`, forced `Development`, and listened on `http://localhost:5098`.

For clean environment verification, the app was restarted with:

```bash
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Test ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://127.0.0.1:5086 \
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection='Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=coglatas;Username=coglatas;Password=...' \
dotnet run --project src/Coglatas.Web --configuration Release --no-build --no-launch-profile
```

A fresh database startup was also run on `http://127.0.0.1:5087` against `coglatas_mvpa_fresh`.

Sensitive values in this report are redacted. Only local throwaway PostgreSQL credentials from the repository's Compose profile were used.

## Important Limitations

- No seeded or bootstrap administrator user exists after fresh startup.
- Authenticated dashboard/admin runtime verification is blocked without creating a user or invite through an approved baseline path.
- `npm test` was attempted before installing frontend dependencies and failed because `playwright` was not present in `node_modules`.
- The full `dotnet test` run passed, but the two PostgreSQL tests return early unless `POSTGRES_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING` is set. A targeted PostgreSQL test run was therefore executed separately with the local connection string.
