# MVP-A Evidence Log

Verification date: 2026-06-24

Result status values: Pass, Partial, Failed, Blocked, Missing, Needs verification.

## A-01 Baseline Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Detailed evidence:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-01-build-test-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-01-baseline-failure-log.md`

Summary: `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and `dotnet test` passed on Windows with .NET SDK 10.0.301; the test runner reported 128/128 passing. Docker build/startup evidence is blocked because the Docker Desktop Linux engine endpoint is unavailable. Local UI test evidence is blocked because Playwright is not installed in `node_modules`. Live PostgreSQL assertions remain Needs verification because `POSTGRES_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING` was not set.

## A-02 Health Check Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Detailed evidence:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-02-health-check-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-02-health-check-failure-log.md`

Summary: the app started locally and `/health/live` returned 200 with `{"status":"OK"}`, but `/health/ready` returned 503 with `{"status":"Unhealthy"}`. Local PostgreSQL on port 5432 was unavailable, Docker Desktop Linux engine was unavailable, and PostgreSQL/container health could not be verified. This A-02 refresh is Blocked and does not imply production approval.

## A-03 Application Smoke Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Detailed evidence:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-03-application-smoke-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-03-smoke-failure-log.md`

Summary: the app started locally on `http://127.0.0.1:18083`; root/login/dashboard SPA shell routes returned 200; `/health/live` returned 200; `/health/ready` returned 503; public auth status returned unauthenticated; CSRF protection rejected unsafe anonymous POSTs; protected anonymous APIs returned 401; API 404 returned safe JSON. Local PostgreSQL on port 5432 and Docker Desktop Linux engine were unavailable. Frontend Angular, Storybook, and root Playwright smoke checks were blocked by incomplete local `node_modules`. This A-03 refresh is Blocked and does not imply production approval, MVP-A Go, or production readiness.

## A-04 AuthZ Boundary Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Detailed evidence:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-04-authz-boundary-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-04-authz-boundary-failure-log.md`

Summary: source inspection and automated backend verification found cookie auth, CSRF, session invalidation, tenant/project/conversation/file isolation, admin denial, audit-log role checks, and security-event tenant scoping materially covered by tests. A test-harness Data Protection key-path failure was fixed, then `AuthSecurityHttpTests` passed 15/15, `TenantIsolation` filtered tests passed 24/24, and the full backend suite passed 128/128. A-04 remains Needs verification for fresh-runtime authenticated smoke because the baseline identity/bootstrap blocker still prevents direct admin/non-admin/wrong-tenant runtime checks on a fresh app baseline. Docker runtime and local PostgreSQL also remained unavailable. This A-04 refresh does not imply production approval, MVP-A Go, or production readiness.

## A-05 Sensitive Data Boundary Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-28

Detailed evidence:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-05-sensitive-data-boundary-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-05-sensitive-data-boundary-failure-log.md`

Summary: repo keyword scans and source inspection found no confirmed committed raw secret in this pass, and the ignored local `.env` was treated as local sensitive config without copying values. A source-level Development error-response leak was fixed by making global unhandled exception responses generic in every environment, and the new regression test plus full backend suite passed 129/129. A-05 remains Needs verification because local redacted Gitleaks reproduction is blocked by missing local `gitleaks` and unavailable Docker daemon, live runtime logs were not captured, authenticated API/UI/export smoke remains blocked by P0-001/P0-002, and existing historical docs/evidence still need broader human review. This A-05 refresh does not imply production approval, MVP-A Go, or production readiness.

## A-07 File Boundary Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-29

Detailed evidence:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-07-file-boundary-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-07-file-boundary-failure-log.md`

Summary: source inspection and automated backend verification found no confirmed unauthorized file-body exposure in the tested synthetic paths after this pass. A metadata-only storage identifier exposure risk was fixed by removing internal storage identifiers from file and artifact-version API response DTOs, private no-store headers were added to file/attachment/artifact download responses, and metadata-only denied file access audit entries were added. The targeted file/storage/tenant-boundary test slice passed 32/32, and the full backend suite passed 134/134. A-07 remains Needs verification for fresh-runtime file smoke under signed-in test users, attachment/conversation sensitive-body actor coverage, removed-participant and explicit-grant/revoked-grant behavior, object-storage/signed-URL behavior, and live PostgreSQL/container evidence. This A-07 refresh does not imply production approval, MVP-A Go, or production readiness.

## A-08 Communication Boundary Refresh

Refresh date: 2026-06-29

Detailed evidence:

- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-08-communication-boundary-baseline.md`
- `docs/evidence/mvp-a/a-08-communication-boundary-failure-log.md`

Summary: source inspection and automated backend verification found no confirmed unauthorized conversation/message body exposure in the tested synthetic paths after this pass. Three communication boundary risks were fixed: removed message authors now must remain active conversation participants to edit/delete, read cursor updates now reject missing/deleted/cross-conversation message IDs, and message notification bodies no longer embed private message text. The focused HTTP tenant and communication-boundary test slice passed 11/11, and the full backend suite passed 138/138. A-08 remains Needs verification for fresh-runtime authenticated communication smoke, same-tenant DM actor matrix, admin/teacher policy, thread coverage, realtime/polling coverage, live audit/log review, live PostgreSQL/container evidence, and final safe-denial status-code classification. This A-08 refresh does not imply production approval, MVP-A Go, or production readiness.

| EV-093 | A-09 conversation denial audit fix | `ConversationService` update | Workspace | Covered conversation/message denial paths now write generic metadata-only audit entries before returning denial results. | Pass | Remaining denial matrix incomplete | No message body copied |
| EV-094 | A-09 login security metadata minimization | `AuthService` update and regression test | Workspace | Login security metadata no longer stores raw submitted email; it records `emailProvided` and `userId` when known. | Pass | `SecurityEvent.Email` policy still Needs verification | Synthetic email only |
| EV-095 | A-09 focused auth/tenant/audit tests | `dotnet test tests\Coglatas.Tests\Coglatas.Tests.csproj --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AuthServiceTests|FullyQualifiedName~TenantIsolationSecurityTests|FullyQualifiedName~HttpTenantIsolationTests"` | Windows host | 42/42 passed: auth metadata minimization, audit/security query tenant scoping, non-admin audit denial, platform-admin global audit reads, and conversation denial audit metadata covered with synthetic data. | Pass | Live runtime still Needs verification | Synthetic data only |
| EV-096 | A-09 full backend suite | `dotnet test tests\Coglatas.Tests\Coglatas.Tests.csproj --no-restore` | Windows host | 146/146 passed after final A-09 changes. | Pass | None | No real logs copied |
| EV-097 | A-09 sandbox restore attempt | `dotnet test tests\Coglatas.Tests\Coglatas.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TenantIsolationSecurityTests|FullyQualifiedName~HttpTenantIsolationTests"` | Sandboxed Windows host | Initial restore/test attempt was blocked because sandbox denied socket access to `api.nuget.org:443`; rerun with approved network restored packages and passed the focused slice. | Blocked | Environment permission | No secrets |
| EV-098 | A-09 remaining audit/security gaps | Source inspection plus focused test review | Windows host | Live audit/security logs, full denial matrix, admin audit matrix, file grant/revoke, destructive-operation attempts, metadata sanitizer completeness, `SecurityEvent.Email` policy, PostgreSQL, and container evidence remain incomplete. | Needs verification | P0-001/P0-002 plus A-09 follow-up | No raw logs copied |

## Evidence Notes

- `Pass` is used only where direct command/runtime/source evidence was collected.
- Authenticated admin/non-admin/tenant runtime checks are not marked Pass because no baseline login user exists.
- No screenshots were captured because curl evidence was sufficient and no private data was exposed.
- A-02 readiness is not accepted in the 2026-06-28 Windows refresh; liveness success is not production approval.
- A-03 smoke success on public shell/protected-anonymous checks is not MVP-A Go; readiness, Docker/PostgreSQL, frontend dependencies, and authenticated runtime checks remain blocked or need verification.
- A-04 automated auth/tenant/audit boundary tests passed after the test-harness Data Protection fix, but fresh-runtime authenticated admin/non-admin/wrong-tenant smoke remains Needs verification until the baseline identity/bootstrap blocker is resolved.
- A-05 fixed a source-level Development exception-message response leak, but A-05 remains Needs verification until redacted scanner artifacts, live logs, authenticated API/UI/export smoke, and historical evidence review are complete.
- A-07 fixed file/artifact API storage identifier response exposure and added private download cache headers plus denied-access audit logging, but A-07 remains Needs verification until fresh-runtime file smoke, attachment/conversation actor matrix, explicit grant/revoked grant behavior, object storage/signed URL behavior, and live runtime evidence are complete.
- A-08 fixed removed-participant message mutation, cross-conversation read cursor, and private message notification-body risks in the tested synthetic paths, but A-08 remains Needs verification until fresh-runtime communication smoke, same-tenant DM/admin policy, thread/realtime coverage, live audit/log review, and live runtime evidence are complete.
- A-09 fixed audit-query tenant scoping, covered conversation/message denial audit logging, and raw submitted-email login security metadata in the tested synthetic paths, but A-09 remains Needs verification until live audit/security logs, the full denial/admin/file/communication matrix, metadata sanitizer policy, and live runtime evidence are complete.
