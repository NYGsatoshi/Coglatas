# MVP-A Implementation Verification Report

Verification date: 2026-06-24

## Summary

MVP-A implementation verification is not complete.

The repository builds, starts, applies EF Core migrations to PostgreSQL, exposes working health checks, protects anonymous API access, and has broad source/test evidence for authorization, tenancy, files, messaging, and audit logging.

The current P0 blocker is baseline identity/bootstrap: a fresh startup seeds a tenant and plans but no user, tenant membership, invite, or administrator. Because of that, authenticated dashboard/admin access, admin-vs-user authorization, cross-tenant runtime checks, and authenticated AuditLog verification are blocked.

2026-06-28 A-04 refresh: automated backend AuthZ boundary verification passed after fixing the auth HTTP test harness Data Protection key path. `AuthSecurityHttpTests` passed 15/15, `TenantIsolation` filtered tests passed 24/24, and the full backend suite passed 128/128. Fresh-runtime admin/non-admin/wrong-tenant smoke remains blocked by the baseline identity/bootstrap gap and is not accepted as MVP-A Go.

2026-06-28 A-05 refresh: a source-level Development error-response leakage risk was fixed by making global unhandled exception responses generic in every environment. Repo keyword scans found no confirmed committed raw secret in this pass, and the full backend suite passed 129/129. A-05 remains Needs verification because redacted Gitleaks reproduction, live logs, authenticated API/UI/export smoke, and historical evidence review are not complete.

2026-06-29 A-07 refresh: a file metadata storage identifier exposure risk was fixed by removing internal storage identifiers from file and artifact-version API response DTOs. File/attachment/artifact downloads now set private no-store headers, denied file metadata/download attempts now write metadata-only audit entries, the targeted file/storage/tenant-boundary test slice passed 32/32, and the full backend suite passed 134/134. A-07 remains Needs verification for fresh-runtime file smoke under signed-in test users, attachment/conversation sensitive-body coverage, removed-participant and explicit-grant/revoked-grant behavior, object-storage/signed-URL behavior, and live PostgreSQL/container evidence.

2026-06-29 A-08 refresh: removed-participant message mutation, cross-conversation read cursor, and private message notification-body risks were fixed in the communication service path. The focused HTTP tenant and communication-boundary test slice passed 11/11, and the full backend suite passed 138/138. A-08 remains Needs verification for fresh-runtime authenticated communication smoke, same-tenant DM non-participant/admin policy, thread coverage, realtime/polling coverage, live audit/log review, and live PostgreSQL/container evidence.

2026-06-29 A-09 refresh: audit-query tenant scoping, covered conversation/message denial audit logging, and login security metadata minimization were fixed. The focused auth/tenant/audit test slice passed 42/42, and the full backend suite passed 146/146. A-09 remains Needs verification for live audit/security log review, full denial/admin/file/communication event matrix coverage, metadata sanitizer policy, `SecurityEvent.Email` policy, and live PostgreSQL/container evidence.

## P0 Blockers

See [mvp-a-p0-blockers.md](mvp-a-p0-blockers.md).

- P0-001: Fresh MVP-A startup has no usable login/admin bootstrap.
- P0-002: End-to-end authorization verification is blocked by missing baseline identity.

## P1 Follow-Up

- Add or document explicit local verification setup for frontend Playwright dependencies; local `npm test` currently fails because `playwright` is not installed.
- Decide whether `/healthz`, `/api/health`, `/ready`, or `/live` aliases are needed. Current canonical endpoints are `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.
- Document that default and on-prem Compose config require `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`; raw `docker compose config` fails without it.
- Verify AuditLog runtime coverage for authorization failures, admin actions, role changes, file operations, and message operations after P0-001.
- Verify file download authorization and messaging tenant/member boundaries with real seeded users after P0-001.
- Review messaging attachment behavior: `ConversationService` stores message attachments as metadata-only, while general file upload uses the file storage service.
- Normalize safe-denial HTTP status mapping where controller/service failures currently return `400` for authorization/not-found denials, if API-contract quality requires 403/404 instead.

## Recommended Next PRs

1. Add the smallest MVP-A verification bootstrap path for a first admin/user and tenant membership, limited to local/dev/test verification and documented startup use.
2. Add a narrow authorization smoke test suite covering anonymous, non-admin, admin, tenant boundary, and file download denial paths.
3. Add AuditLog smoke checks for login success/failure, logout, admin role/action, file upload/download/delete, and message send/delete.
4. Update local verification docs for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `--no-launch-profile`, and frontend test dependency setup.
5. Add A-07 attachment/conversation/grant matrix tests after the baseline identity/bootstrap path exists.
6. Add A-08 same-tenant DM, admin policy, thread, realtime/polling, and live audit/log matrix tests after the baseline identity/bootstrap path exists.
