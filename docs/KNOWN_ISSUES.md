# Known Issues

Last WPC creation remediation audit: 2026-08-24.

This list records confirmed implementation/documentation mismatches and major unknowns. It is not limited to defects already filed in GitHub.

## WPC canonical creation status

The original WPC-01 items are no longer active backend blockers:

- **WPC-01-001 resolved by WPC-02A:** canonical Project Visibility and
  activation provenance are persisted. Legacy rows remain explicitly unknown;
  no migration inferred or broadened their authorization.
- **WPC-01-002 resolved by WPC-02C:** Workspace-scoped Project creation has an
  explicit server-authorized, idempotent command. The deprecated unscoped
  compatibility route remains disabled.
- **WPC-01-003 and WPC-01-004 resolved by WPC-02B:** current Tenant-scoped
  `workspace.create` grants are persisted and evaluated, and Workspace create
  atomically provisions the canonical `WorkspaceGeneral` Conversation.
- **WPC-01-005 resolved by WPC-02D:** the explicit activation command owns
  ProjectGeneral and Task-workflow provisioning under one guarded persistence
  boundary. Generic lifecycle update remains unable to bypass activation.

The provider-backed WPC-Final01 through Final03 verification records remain
the source of truth for those merged backend boundaries. Frontend integration
Issues such as Workspace create (#408) and Project create/activation (#409)
must consume them without duplicating authority in the browser.

## Backend application logic audit findings

The detailed controller, service, validation, error-handling, file, project, messaging, announcement, DI, and HTTP-status audit is maintained in `docs/BACKEND_LOGIC_AUDIT.md`.

The highest-severity confirmed findings are:

- **BE-001, resolved by the current WS-01-BE candidate:** Announcement list, detail/read-status, Search, and the Workspace dashboard unread aggregate now share the SQL-translatable `AnnouncementReadScope`. Its global, Workspace-only, Group, and Channel audience branches are mutually exclusive; public/announcement channels use Group membership, while private/confidential channels require explicit Channel membership.
- **BE-002, resolved by the current PR #281 candidate:** Project-derived Search,
  the non-Archived Project list, project-bound Messaging, and the Project
  boundary used by My Tasks now share one SQL-translatable form of the current
  `CanViewProject` policy. The list alone adds narrowly authorized Archived
  history for current Workspace members with explicit Project membership. This closes
  disclosure of Project, Task, Artifact, ActivityLog, Comment, and
  project-bound Message content without claiming canonical Visibility
  persistence. Production PostgreSQL Conversation list/count and Message Search
  now share one depth-bounded recursive ancestry relation and fail closed on
  missing, inconsistent, cyclic, or deeper-than-32 hierarchies. Message Search
  composes that relation over every matching Conversation before deterministic
  Message ordering and the final result bound; it no longer authorizes an
  arbitrary first 100 Conversation IDs. A real-PostgreSQL regression covers 125
  authorized matching Conversations, the newest authorized Message outside the
  former first 100, tied timestamps, and an unauthorized nested Thread with a
  revoked ancestor whose title/body remain absent. Thread creation cannot
  persist a child beyond that readable boundary.
- **BE-003, resolved for direct-message MVP:** direct conversation creation now derives an active shared workspace server-side instead of writing `WorkspaceId = Guid.Empty`; broader PostgreSQL coverage for all conversation creation modes is still recommended.
- **BE-004, critical:** message attachment requests trust client storage metadata and create records without required workspace/file-object relationships.
- **BE-005, high:** post update/delete/pin operations mutate entities loaded with `AsNoTracking`, so successful responses may not correspond to persisted changes.
- **BE-006, high:** assignee task filtering launches parallel EF operations on one scoped `DbContext`.
- **BE-007, high:** file and artifact uploads can leave orphaned or partial files when metadata persistence fails.
- **BE-008 through BE-012, high:** conversation read-state integrity, task notification targets, duplicate My Tasks rows, notification length limits, and HTTP/error mapping require focused patches.

Use the backend audit document for exact files, methods, impact, patch suggestions, test cases, validation gaps, and the issue-ready list. These findings supersede any broader status label that calls the affected workflow fully implemented without qualification.

## Frontend UI audit findings

Audit scope: browser rendering, navigation, dashboard behavior, login/register/admin UI, Japanese localization, responsive CSS, accessibility, broken links, and client-side JavaScript. These UI-001 through UI-024 findings describe the removed legacy vanilla-JavaScript SPA that lived under `src/Coglatas.Web/wwwroot`.

Status after the MVP-A P0 Angular migration: obsolete as active frontend defects. Do not treat the listed legacy routes, DOM selectors, mocked fixtures, JavaScript entrypoints, CSS bundles, screenshot behavior, or `wwwroot/scripts` files as P0 acceptance contracts. Re-open only defects that are reproduced against the Angular frontend under `frontend/`.

### UI-001: API-provided module routes do not match SPA routes

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed mismatch.
- Evidence: seeded module routes include `/dashboard`, `/messages`, `/files`, `/production`, and `/admin`; `main.js` implements `/`, `/dm`, `/artifacts`, `/projects`, `/tenant-admin`, and `/platform-admin`. `navigation.js` prefers `module.defaultRoute`, so its route aliases are ignored when the API supplies a route.
- Reproduction: seed UI-shell modules, authenticate, and select Dashboard, Messaging, Files, Production Tracking, or Admin.
- Expected: the implemented page opens.
- Actual: a placeholder page opens, or the wrong route is marked active.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/main.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/components/navigation.js`, `AppDbContextSeed.cs`.
- Suggested issue: **Canonicalize server-provided module routes before rendering navigation**.

### UI-002: Navigation listeners accumulate and duplicate history entries

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed client-side bug.
- Evidence: `renderNavigation` attaches click handlers, then every `renderRoute` call attaches another handler to every `[data-route]` link.
- Reproduction: navigate between several pages and use the browser Back button.
- Expected: one history entry and one render per click.
- Actual: duplicate `pushState` calls, repeated API loads, and multiple Back operations can be required.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/main.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/components/navigation.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Use one delegated SPA navigation handler**.

### UI-003: Mobile header overflows narrow viewports

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed CSS layout defect.
- Evidence: the brand has `min-width: 150px` and search has `min-width: 160px`; notification, language, logout, and navigation controls remain visible below 760px.
- Reproduction: open an authenticated page at a 320px to 393px viewport.
- Expected: all header controls remain reachable without horizontal scrolling.
- Actual: controls can overflow, become compressed, or be clipped.
- Files: `wwwroot/styles/app.css`, `wwwroot/scripts/components/shell.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Add a compact mobile-header layout**.

### UI-004: Mobile sidebar remains open after navigation

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed behavior and accessibility defect.
- Evidence: the toggle only changes `is-sidebar-open`; route changes do not close it. The toggle lacks `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Playwright helpers manually close the sidebar after navigation.
- Reproduction: open the sidebar on mobile and select Projects.
- Expected: the sidebar closes and focus moves to the new page.
- Actual: the sidebar remains over the rendered page.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/components/shell.js`, `wwwroot/styles/app.css`, `tests/ui/app.spec.ts`.
- Suggested issue: **Close and announce the mobile navigation drawer correctly**.

### UI-005: Navigation exposes placeholder-only pages

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed missing UI; overlaps `KI-008`.
- Evidence: Workspaces, Groups, Channels, Tasks, Artifacts, Calendar, Forms, and search results render placeholder content.
- Reproduction: select any affected primary-navigation item.
- Expected: a functional page, or a clearly disabled/preview-labelled navigation item.
- Actual: normal-looking navigation leads to an unimplemented screen.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/components/navigation.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/pages/placeholders.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Hide or label placeholder navigation until workflows are implemented**.

### UI-006: Notification links target unsupported frontend routes

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed broken-link behavior.
- Evidence: notification routes can be `/events/{id}`, `/forms/{id}`, `/tasks/{id}`, `/artifacts/{id}`, `/messages/{id}`, or `/posts/{id}`; the SPA does not implement those detail routes.
- Reproduction: open a task, event, form, artifact, message, or post notification.
- Expected: the related detail page opens.
- Actual: the SPA renders a placeholder.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/notifications.js`, `DbNotificationService.cs`, `wwwroot/scripts/main.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Only render notification links for supported routes**.

### UI-007: Login trims passwords before submission

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed login UI bug.
- Evidence: the login handler calls `.trim()` on the password field.
- Reproduction: authenticate with a valid password containing a leading or trailing space.
- Expected: the exact entered password is submitted.
- Actual: whitespace is removed and authentication fails.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/components/shell.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Preserve password input exactly as entered**.

### UI-008: Login localization flashes Japanese and exposes English API errors

- Priority: low.
- Status: confirmed localization gap.
- Evidence: `index.html` contains a hardcoded Japanese login form before JavaScript applies the stored locale. API `{ error }` strings are displayed directly and are commonly English.
- Reproduction: store `coglatas.locale=en-US` and reload on a slow connection, or fail login while using Japanese.
- Expected: one consistent selected language.
- Actual: a Japanese login flash or mixed Japanese/English error text.
- Files: `wwwroot/index.html`, `wwwroot/scripts/api.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/components/shell.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Render the initial login state from the locale layer and define UI error localization rules**.

### UI-009: Invite registration has no browser page

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed missing UI.
- Evidence: the backend exposes `POST /api/auth/register-by-invite`, but `AuthApi` and the SPA router have no invite-registration flow. Unauthenticated routes always display login.
- Reproduction: visit an invite-registration URL while signed out.
- Expected: a token-aware registration form.
- Actual: the login form is displayed.
- Files: `AuthController.cs`, `wwwroot/scripts/api.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/main.js`.
- Dependency: invite membership behavior remains incomplete under `KI-002`.
- Suggested issue: **Define the supported invite URL and add registration UI after membership semantics are fixed**.

### UI-010: Date-only values can render one day early

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed timezone defect.
- Evidence: `formatDate` parses `YYYY-MM-DD` with `new Date(value)`, which treats it as UTC before formatting in the browser timezone.
- Reproduction: in `America/Los_Angeles`, render the date `2026-06-01`.
- Expected: June 1, 2026.
- Actual: May 31, 2026 can be shown.
- Affected pages: dashboard, projects, tasks, milestones, and Gantt.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/utils.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Format date-only values without UTC conversion**.

### UI-011: Dashboard links inserted asynchronously miss SPA routing

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed rendering-order defect.
- Evidence: `renderDashboard` starts asynchronous section loads and returns; `renderRoute` binds existing links before task/project links are inserted.
- Reproduction: populate dashboard tasks or projects and select one.
- Expected: client-side navigation using `pushState`.
- Actual: the browser performs a full document navigation and rebuilds the shell.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/dashboard.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/main.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Use delegated routing for asynchronously rendered links**.

### UI-012: Messaging uses the wrong current-user ID property

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed DTO mismatch; expands `KI-007`.
- Evidence: `CurrentUserResponse` serializes `userId`, while messaging reads `currentUser.id`. Playwright fixtures incorrectly mock `id`.
- Reproduction: use the real `/api/auth/me` response and open a direct conversation.
- Expected: the other member is used as the title, own messages are styled as mine, and the current user is excluded from the picker.
- Actual: titles and own-message styling can be wrong, and the current user can remain selectable.
- Files: `CurrentUserResponse.cs`, `wwwroot/scripts/pages/messaging.js`, `tests/ui/app.fixtures.ts`.
- Suggested issue: **Align current-user DTO usage and fixtures**.

### UI-013: Conversation creation sends an incompatible enum representation

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed frontend/backend integration mismatch.
- Evidence: the UI sends `"Direct"` or `"Group"`; MVC uses default `System.Text.Json` enum handling because no `JsonStringEnumConverter` is configured.
- Reproduction: submit New Conversation against the real ASP.NET Core API.
- Expected: the conversation is created.
- Actual: JSON model binding rejects the request before the controller action completes.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/messaging.js`, `Extensions/DependencyInjection.cs`, `MessagingDtos.cs`.
- Suggested issue: **Send numeric conversation enum values from the UI and add a contract test**.

### UI-014: Messaging polling destroys drafts and continues after leaving

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed client-side lifecycle bug.
- Evidence: every eight seconds `loadConversationDetail` replaces the complete detail DOM, including the composer. The interval is cleared only when `renderMessaging` runs again, not when another page is rendered.
- Reproduction: type an unsent message and wait eight seconds; then navigate away from the DM detail page.
- Expected: the draft and focus are preserved, and polling stops after leaving.
- Actual: the draft is erased; after leaving, polling accesses a missing detail element and can produce unhandled promise rejections.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/messaging.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/main.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Add route-aware messaging polling that preserves composer state**.

### UI-015: New Conversation is a dead end for most users

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed UI/API availability mismatch.
- Evidence: the user picker calls PlatformAdmin-only `GET /api/admin/users`, while the New button is shown to all authenticated users.
- Reproduction: sign in as Staff, Teacher, or a normal user and select New in Messaging.
- Expected: a permitted tenant/workspace member picker, or no creation action.
- Actual: the form opens and reports that user search is unavailable.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/messaging.js`, `AdminController.cs`.
- Suggested issue: **Hide the unusable creation action until a scoped member-picker API is available**.

### UI-016: Announcement create/edit sends incompatible priority values

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed frontend/backend integration mismatch.
- Evidence: the UI sends `"Normal"`, `"Important"`, or `"Urgent"` while MVC expects numeric enums. The edit selector compares localized `enumLabel` output with English strings.
- Reproduction: create an announcement against the real API, or edit an Important/Urgent announcement in Japanese.
- Expected: the request binds successfully and existing priority remains selected.
- Actual: model binding can reject the request; in Japanese the selector defaults to Normal.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/announcements.js`, `Extensions/DependencyInjection.cs`, `AnnouncementDtos.cs`.
- Suggested issue: **Use numeric announcement priority values and locale-independent selection logic**.

### UI-017: Announcement author and role checks are incorrect

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed UI visibility bug.
- Evidence: author checks use `user.id` instead of `user.userId`. Numeric role `4` is PlatformOperator, but the UI treats it as announcement-capable while omitting numeric PlatformAdmin role `5`.
- Reproduction: view an authored announcement as its normal author, a PlatformOperator, or a numeric PlatformAdmin.
- Expected: edit/create controls match known capabilities.
- Actual: controls can be missing or incorrectly displayed.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/announcements.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/enums.js`.
- Constraint: this is a UI visibility issue; backend authorization remains authoritative and must not be weakened.
- Suggested issue: **Correct announcement UI identity and role constants without changing authorization**.

### UI-018: Japanese localization is incomplete on announcements and admin pages

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed localization gap.
- Evidence: announcement forms, read status, badges, admin dashboards, quota labels, tenant state text, and onboarding checklists contain hardcoded English. Project task selectors expose enum identifiers such as `NotStarted` and `WaitingReview`.
- Reproduction: select Japanese and visit Announcements, Tenant Admin, Platform Admin, onboarding, or a task editor.
- Expected: Japanese interface text except user-generated content.
- Actual: mixed English and Japanese UI.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/announcements.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/pages/admin.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/pages/projects.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/i18n/locales/ja-JP.js`.
- Documentation mismatch: this violates `docs/FRONTEND_I18N.md`.
- Suggested issue: **Complete Japanese localization for implemented pages**.

### UI-019: Task mutations leave stale UI and can raise unhandled rejections

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed client-side behavior bug.
- Evidence: task create/update awaits the API without `try/catch`, then only writes “Saved.” The task list is not reloaded. Assignment and comment mutations have similar unhandled-error paths.
- Reproduction: create or edit a task, then mock a POST/PATCH failure.
- Expected: the task list refreshes after success and an inline error appears after failure.
- Actual: the list remains stale after success; failures can produce console errors without user feedback.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/projects.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Refresh project task state and handle mutation errors inline**.

### UI-020: Project comments display raw user IDs

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed rendering/contract mismatch.
- Evidence: the UI expects `authorDisplayName`, but `CommentResponse` only supplies `AuthorUserId`.
- Reproduction: open a project or task containing existing comments.
- Expected: a recognizable author name.
- Actual: a GUID is displayed.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/projects.js`, `ProjectDtos.cs`.
- Suggested issue: **Render a documented comment-author representation**.

### UI-021: Project tabs and list layouts have accessibility gaps

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed accessibility defect.
- Evidence: ARIA tabs only handle click events and do not support ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Home, or End. Positional list grids have no column headers, and active navigation links have no `aria-current`.
- Reproduction: navigate project tabs and list rows with a keyboard or screen reader.
- Expected: standard ARIA tab behavior and announced current-page/column context.
- Actual: click-only tab activation and unlabeled positional values.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/projects.js`, `wwwroot/scripts/components/navigation.js`, `wwwroot/styles/app.css`.
- Suggested issue: **Add keyboard tab behavior and accessible list metadata**.

### UI-022: Tenant Admin upload limit always appears 100% used

- Priority: high.
- Status: confirmed dashboard calculation bug.
- Evidence: `fileUploadLimitBytes` is passed as both the used value and the limit value to `quotaRow`.
- Reproduction: configure any file upload limit and open Tenant Admin.
- Expected: a standalone maximum-upload value or meaningful usage calculation.
- Actual: a red/danger 100% quota is displayed.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/pages/admin.js`.
- Suggested issue: **Render file upload limits separately from consumable quota usage**.

### UI-023: Invalid date values can be interpreted as HTML

- Priority: low.
- Status: confirmed escaping defect with limited exploitability under typed backend contracts.
- Evidence: `formatDate` returns an invalid input unchanged, and callers insert that value through `innerHTML`.
- Reproduction: mock a notification or project date as `<b>invalid</b>`.
- Expected: literal escaped text.
- Actual: HTML markup is rendered.
- Files: `wwwroot/scripts/utils.js` and its date-rendering callers.
- Suggested issue: **Escape invalid date fallbacks or return text-only values**.

### UI-024: Initial and mutation browser tests hide real integration defects

- Priority: medium.
- Status: confirmed test gap; expands `KI-009`.
- Evidence: fixtures use `id` instead of `userId`, return no UI modules, accept string enum payloads, use English only, manually close the mobile sidebar, and do not test failed task mutation submissions or DM polling.
- Impact: route, DTO, enum, localization, mobile navigation, and polling regressions can pass.
- Files: `tests/ui/app.fixtures.ts`, `tests/ui/app.spec.ts`.
- Suggested issue: **Make UI fixtures contract-accurate and add targeted navigation, Japanese, mutation, and polling tests**.

### Frontend audit verification

- Legacy JavaScript syntax checks applied only to the removed static SPA under `wwwroot/scripts`.
- Release build completed successfully.
- All 123 .NET tests passed.
- Playwright dependencies and Chromium downloaded, but browser execution was blocked in the audit container because `libatk-1.0.so.0` was unavailable. The reported Playwright failures were browser-launch infrastructure failures, not application assertions.
- No broad refactor or backend, authentication, database, or service change was made during the audit.

## High priority

### KI-001: First-administrator bootstrap requires explicit startup seed control

- Status: implemented with operational constraints.
- Evidence: `Program.cs` reads `COGLATAS_SEED_ADMIN_ENABLED`; `AppDbContextSeed.cs` creates or updates a platform administrator through `IPasswordHasher` and default-tenant owner membership.
- Constraint: `PlatformAdminSetupMode` still does not create an administrator, and bootstrap credentials must come from deployment environment variables or secret management.
- Suggested issue: **Add an audited operator runbook for first-PlatformAdmin bootstrap and post-bootstrap disablement**.

### KI-002: Invite registration does not create membership

- Status: partially implemented.
- Evidence: `AuthService.RegisterByInviteAsync` creates `User` and `Session` and marks the invite accepted, but creates no `TenantUser` or `WorkspaceMember`.
- Impact: the new cookie can be rejected on tenant API routes because active tenant membership is required.
- Suggested issue: **Complete invite acceptance with tenant and workspace membership transaction**.

### KI-003: Feature and platform configuration switches are not enforcement gates

- Status: confirmed mismatch.
- Evidence: `FeatureOptions` is only bound; most `PlatformOptions` values are never read outside binding. Tenant feature checks use `FeatureFlagService`.
- Impact: operators can believe webhooks, API tokens, platform admin, forms, or other modules are disabled when routes remain available to authorized users.
- Suggested issue: **Wire app configuration switches into route/service authorization or remove them**.

### KI-004: Object storage is configuration-only

- Status: planned.
- Evidence: object provider names resolve to `UnsupportedObjectStorageService`; readiness returns false for them.
- Impact: SaaS example configurations cannot store or read files.
- Suggested issue: **Implement and test an S3-compatible object-storage adapter**.

### KI-005: On-prem Compose fresh-stack startup requires runtime evidence

- Status: migration path verified under Issue #465; full app startup verification pending.
- Evidence: `docker-compose.onprem.yml` now uses a one-shot SDK `migrate` service and makes the app wait for successful completion. An isolated clean PostgreSQL volume applied all current migrations successfully; the app itself still does not auto-migrate.
- Remaining impact: the intended TLS/reverse-proxy topology, production build-secret availability, and a clean-volume startup still require recorded execution evidence.
- Tracking issue: **#465 — Make on-prem Compose migrate a fresh database before app startup**.

### KI-006: Reverse-proxy HTTPS behavior still requires deployment-specific verification

- Status: configuration boundary and repeatable deployment gate implemented; target-host execution pending.
- Evidence: `Program.cs` enables forwarded headers only after an operator opts in and supplies explicit IP/CIDR trust boundaries; it retains loopback defaults rather than trusting all peers. `docker-compose.onprem.yml` binds the origin to loopback by default and fails startup when proxy mode lacks a boundary. Focused Kestrel coverage verifies secure CSRF-cookie issuance through a trusted forwarded HTTPS request. Issue #481 adds `tests/ui/public-https-golden-path.spec.ts` and a protected manual workflow that requires the real public HTTPS route, HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect, HSTS, Secure cookies, CSRF, authenticated Task execution, reload, logout, and re-login.
- Remaining impact: an operator can still misstate the trusted proxy peer or public DNS/TLS route, and the gate cannot execute until its protected synthetic fixture is configured. The exact target topology remains unverified until a successful recorded public-gate run; `/health/ready` alone is not sufficient.
- Tracking issues: **#467 — Decide and verify the on-prem TLS/reverse-proxy topology**; **#481 — Public HTTPS Production Golden Path**.

## Medium priority

### KI-007: Frontend current-user contract uses the wrong ID property

- Status: confirmed mismatch.
- Evidence: backend serializes `CurrentUserResponse.UserId`; frontend messaging/announcement logic reads `user.id`.
- Impact: own-message detection, conversation titles, and author edit checks can be wrong.
- Test gap: Playwright mocks return `id`, hiding the mismatch.
- Suggested issue: **Align frontend auth DTO usage and add a real contract test**.

### KI-008: Browser navigation overstates implemented UI

- Status: confirmed mismatch.
- Evidence: `/workspaces`, `/groups`, `/channels`, `/tasks`, `/artifacts`, `/calendar`, `/forms`, and search results render placeholders.
- Backend APIs exist for many of these areas.
- Suggested issue: **Label or hide placeholder navigation until workflows are implemented**.

### KI-009: Playwright does not test the real backend

- Status: partially resolved for MVP0 smoke coverage.
- Evidence: `tests/ui/real-backend-smoke.spec.ts` runs through the isolated
  `docker-compose.real-backend-smoke.yml` stack against ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL,
  cookie auth, and CSRF using synthetic seeded data. The regular Angular suite
  remains static and mocked by design.
- Remaining impact: the MVP0 smoke is intentionally narrow and does not replace
  broad frontend/backend contract, authorization, or PostgreSQL regression
  coverage.

### KI-010: API error contract is inconsistent

- Status: confirmed mismatch.
- Evidence: global exceptions use `ErrorResponse(Code, Message, TraceId)`; many controllers return `{ error }`; authorization/not-found failures frequently return 400.
- Mismatch: `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` described one shared error shape.
- Expanded evidence: backend audit `BE-012` documents inconsistent success codes, error categories, and controller-local mappings.
- Suggested issue: **Standardize API problem/error responses and status mapping**.

### KI-011: PostgreSQL execution requires live-environment evidence

- Status: implementation safeguard added; execution evidence remains environment-dependent.
- Evidence: `PostgreSqlFactAttribute` explicitly skips locally without `POSTGRES_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING`, while `PostgreSqlTestEnvironment.RequireConnectionString()` fails when `CI=true` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` and it is absent.
- Impact: unconfigured tests no longer become false passes, but a green local non-PostgreSQL run is still not PostgreSQL evidence.

### KI-012: Tenant export is not backup or restore

- Status: partial feature.
- Evidence: metadata ZIP is generated in memory; file bodies are excluded; no import exists.
- Suggested issue: **Define tenant export completeness and implement a separately reviewed restore design**.

### KI-013: Admin and tenant-management browser UIs are mostly read-only

- Status: partial UI.
- Evidence: admin pages show summaries, tenants, plans, usage, and features, but do not expose most mutation APIs.
- Suggested issue: **Define supported admin UI scope and implement the minimum safe management flows**.

### KI-014: Tenant “invite” endpoint only adds an existing user

- Status: naming mismatch.
- Evidence: `POST /api/tenant/users/invite` accepts `UserId` and calls `AddCurrentTenantUserAsync`.
- Impact: it is not an email/token invitation workflow.
- Suggested issue: **Rename tenant user add endpoint or implement a real tenant invitation flow**.

## Low priority and compatibility debt

### KI-015: `SystemAdmin` is a compatibility alias

- Status: deprecated naming.
- Evidence: `SystemRole.SystemAdmin = PlatformAdmin`.
- Impact: mixed naming persists in controller role strings and services.
- Suggested issue: **Normalize PlatformAdmin naming while preserving serialized compatibility**.

### KI-016: Dockerfile used .NET 10 preview image tags

- Status: resolved.
- Evidence: Dockerfile and Compose migration services use `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/*:10.0`.
- Impact: older deployments built before this change may still run preview images until rebuilt.
- Suggested issue: **Rebuild deployed containers after switching to stable .NET 10 image tags**.

### KI-017: File scan records exist without a scanning pipeline

- Status: foundation only.
- Evidence: `FileScanResult` and scan status fields exist; no scanner or background worker was found.
- Suggested issue: **Define malware-scanning behavior before accepting untrusted pilot uploads**.

### KI-018: Archived status reports contain resolved and stale claims

- Status: documentation mismatch.
- Evidence: `docs/archive/status/PILOT_STATUS.md` and reports describe older test counts and missing controls that were later added.
- Resolution: keep them archived and use `docs/archive/README.md` for context.

## Planned features, not current capabilities

- Password reset delivery.
- API token authentication middleware and request metering.
- Outbound webhook delivery.
- Object storage and signed URLs.
- Full tenant restore.
- Email delivery.
- SSO/MFA.
- Realtime messaging/notifications.
- Background jobs and scheduled reminders.
- Task automation, server Project File materialization, durable Task results,
  and the contest end-to-end execution path. Issue #461 fixes the provider to
  the no-Web `FirstPartyProjectFilesRuntimeV1` contract; #462 and #463 own
  materialization and durable result implementation respectively. Outbound Web
  retrieval remains out of scope and disabled.
- Full billing/payment integration.
- Advanced Gantt/resource planning.
- Full free-form docking/radial UI.
