# PERF-05 PostgreSQL structural regression gate

Issue #606 adds request-local Npgsql command observation inside the explicit
PERF-02 fixture boundary. Both `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Test` and
`COGLATAS_PERFORMANCE_CI_FIXTURE_ENABLED=true` are required; the additional
`COGLATAS_PERFORMANCE_DB_CAPTURE_ENABLED=true` opt-in activates measurement.
Production/Development do not register the listener or middleware.

## Inventory and budgets

`db-scenarios.json` registers the nine current major list surfaces from
PERF-01. Each profile exercises two page sizes, repeated first/second pages,
and five measured iterations after a separate exact-route warm-up. Message
pages use the implemented timestamp cursor. Repeated identities/order,
disjoint adjacent pages, and fixture cardinalities are checked in memory;
response content and identifiers are not saved.

The structural policy is source-owned and finite: command hard ceiling,
fixed-page small-to-medium growth, page-size growth, actual database-page
materialization, and an extreme slow-command ceiling. Budget rationale,
source evidence, and the inventory main SHA are versioned. The validator
rejects missing inventory entries, disabled/infinite thresholds, missing or
duplicate measurements, incomplete instrumentation, inconsistent totals,
and unknown fields in command evidence.

The PostgreSQL gate job requires both collectors to succeed. It recomputes
per-sample structural decisions, compares both fixture cardinalities, and
fails on any structural violation. A passing Python/unit test is not a
passing product scenario.

## Safe instrumentation

Npgsql Activity spans count both EF commands and directly executed Npgsql
commands exactly once. Their SQL stays in memory: string/numeric literals,
parameters and comments are normalized before computing a SHA-256 identity.
Only the fingerprint, duration, failed boolean, allowlisted root table, and
outer-query LIMIT/ORDER flags leave the process. Activity tags, events,
exception descriptions, SQL text and parameter values are never serialized.

EF supplies `readOperations` where available. This is a safe upper bound on
rows consumed: it includes the final false Read attempt and is not called an
exact returned-row count. Direct Npgsql commands have null row evidence.
Nested predicate/JOIN LIMIT/ORDER clauses cannot masquerade as page clauses.
An EF derived root source can supply its bounded ordered collection page. The gate
requires a bounded ordered reader of the expected collection and rejects
oversized reads, including unbounded collection reads preceding an apparent
paged query. Batched related-table reads are not confused with page readers.

Each synthetic request has an opaque capture UUID. Its typed evidence file
is read, allowlist-validated and deleted; only the validated aggregate is
uploaded. Neither responses nor cookies, CSRF/login tokens, passwords,
parameters, connection strings, database error messages or raw EXPLAIN plans
are uploaded. Unknown capture fields fail before aggregation.

## Selected plan invariant

The canonical full-entity Task ID lookup is inspected on the deterministic medium fixture
with at least 3,000 Task rows, after ANALYZE. `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` must retain
an index equality lookup on the Task `Id` key. Index Scan, Index Only Scan and
the corresponding bitmap path satisfy the invariant when their index
condition constrains that key. Equivalent physical index names are accepted.
Costs, text, minor-version details and unrelated Seq Scans are not asserted. Only a
boolean result, check ID, allowlisted node types, table cardinality and sanitized
index categories (`primary-key`, `task-project-key`, or `other`) are retained.
Index names and conditions remain in memory; the categories do not change the
blocking key-lookup invariant. The planner is
not forced with `enable_seqscan=off`, and the check is not run on a small table.

## Duration adapter

PR checks block the ten-second per-command emergency ceiling only; they do
not block microsecond differences or single-run relative timing changes.
Five exact-page samples of `db.total_time_ms` are emitted for every scenario
in the PERF-03 measurement envelope. Page sizes are never mixed.

Main and nightly feed the page-5 stream and the PERF-02 fingerprint to the
existing PERF-03 comparator. Without an approved main baseline, its result
remains invalid/missing-baseline; current or PR samples are never silently
approved as a baseline. Repeated raw samples remain available for baseline
review and DB-time trends. `db-compare.py --baselines <directory>` supports
approved baseline documents at `<profile>/<scenario>.json` and blocks all
non-pass comparisons, including when the baseline directory is absent. Main
and nightly explicitly use `performance/baselines/db/`; the repository has
no approved documents there today. Baseline governance remains owned by
PERF-03. Missing, duplicate, or wrong-page duration streams also fail closed.

Baseline preparation must follow successful, reviewed product remediation
and a current-main fixture-version-2 collection. Do not promote the failing
draft's samples. Record the exact approved main SHA, both fixture hashes,
environment compatibility keys, repeated samples, and before/after evidence
through the PERF-03 review ledger before enabling comparisons. Fixture-1
documents cannot silently become fixture-2 baselines.

Production fingerprints retain the complete application image ID and exact
source SHA, and separately record `applicationRuntime` for cross-SHA environment
compatibility. This identity hashes the actual installed package inventory,
container configuration, architecture/OS and digest-pinned runtime Dockerfile
recipe. Only the two source-owned application copy sequences are excluded from
the runtime recipe. Unsupported filesystem boundaries fail closed. Full and
prebuilt production images share this runtime boundary; source-mode and legacy
fingerprints continue to require the complete image identity. Old/new fingerprint
formats are incompatible. CPU, toolchain, PostgreSQL, browser and fixture checks
remain mandatory, as do baseline approval, distinct SHA and variability checks.

`performance-db-baseline-capture.yml` is an explicit main-only preparation lane.
It restores the successful exact-main runtime producer, runs the unchanged
small/medium collectors and rejects structural regressions. Its five canonical
duration samples per scenario/profile remain unapproved candidates. Collection
success does not grant duration acceptance or replace `performance-db.yml`,
which still rejects missing/incompatible/unapproved duration baselines on main.
Review the complete samples and source/run/attempt/artifact fingerprints before
registering approved documents; no sample is excluded to lower variability.

## Routing and exact-SHA build reuse

The stable `PostgreSQL query regression gate` is created on every PR to main.
`db-ci.py` records the head/base SHA, changed-file count/hash, applicability,
and reason. Established documentation/frontend-only changes are explicitly
not applicable. Backend, performance, dependency, workflow, unknown, empty,
and unavailable-diff cases run conservatively. Only an explicit unrelated
route paired with a skipped collector can produce `not-applicable`.
Relevant skipped, missing, cancelled, failed, or partial lanes fail.

Untrusted PRs use the secret-free Release source runtime. Trusted main runs
are invoked by the main artifact hub through `workflow_call` and reuse its
runtime image and Release outputs. Schedule/dispatch resolves a completed
main push at the exact target SHA, requires the runtime assembler job to have
succeeded and its artifact to remain available, then verifies the source and
.NET stamps during restoration. Missing artifacts fail; they never trigger
an implicit licensed rebuild. No build credential is needed by this lane.
The main caller runs even when its producer failed or skipped: an explicit
unrelated route still yields not-applicable, while required reuse first
requires the producer result to be success. A failed producer's leftover
artifact cannot satisfy the required lane.

Collectors, fingerprints, routing, and aggregation must all match the tested
workflow SHA. For PRs this is GitHub's tested merge revision, which differs
from the contributor's head SHA. The sanitized aggregate preserves the
workflow/run identity, scenario-contract hash, fixture hashes, environment
fingerprint hashes, and structural/duration decisions. This DB evidence is
an input to PERF-11; it does not implement the program-wide `ci/performance`
or exact-SHA release acceptance by itself.

## Existing product debt is deliberately detected

The source inventory at `bb6d04351a55a954b01e5e732add3ba8a366cdb9` already has
structural violations:

- Project list: application-side paging plus per-row permission checks.
- Task list: full-project materialization, per-Task authorization and
  application-side paging.
- Conversation list: last-message/read/unread/member lookups per row.
- Announcement list: read-confirmation lookup per row.
- Notification list: current-target visibility resolution in batches/per row.
- Workspace list: currently unpaged; it is inventoried and tested for query
  growth, without inventing a paging parameter contract.

These are documented in each scenario, not exempted or made green with
cardinality-dependent budgets. #606 explicitly excludes fixing #74/#78
product behavior. If execution confirms these violations, this PR must stay
unmerged until separately authorized product remediation is available. No
claim of full Issue acceptance or green CI may be based on local unit tests.

### Latest executed evidence and remaining blockers

Draft head `3636c378831e00243858239ce34d8c1b81e2ec7e` tested merge SHA
`d1ea51ce1edbd7428b10c72701ca1088f79db6b2`. Routing and both collectors succeeded in
[run 37161098932](https://github.com/NYGsatoshi/Coglatas/actions/runs/37161098932);
the aggregate reported twelve failed product checks:

- Project lists lacked ordered DB paging; the medium profile also exceeded
  the command ceiling and materialized an unbounded collection. Both dataset
  growth and page-size growth failed.
- Task lists issued exactly 1,452 commands for the small profile and 6,252
  for medium, exceeded the ceiling, and materialized the unbounded collection.
- Conversation lists exceeded the medium command ceiling (maximum 120)
  and failed dataset/page-size growth.
- Notifications over-materialized both page profiles and increased from four
  to nine commands with dataset cardinality.
- Announcements failed page-size query growth.

The selected `task.id-index-lookup` semantic invariant passed in that run.
The earlier head `86aaf5a5b0fcd43b54a97e3c3b78562d3e83ce72` had failed a
physical-index-name assertion despite using an Index Scan. The updated invariant
requires a selective indexed equality on Task `Id` and now has executed proof;
no product index or planner setting was changed. The medium diagnostic reported
only `task-project-key`, with an Index Scan on 3,000 rows. The persisted route,
structural result and final gate all match the tested merge SHA and workflow
run/attempt. The final aggregate remains `regression`.

These results belong to the previously executed candidate. The CI-only
repair of routing, source binding, image reuse, fixture metadata and static
analysis must be re-executed before any new runtime claim. PR CI and API
Performance passed on `8ee0bf8b`; the DB fixture version 2 remains isolated from
the unchanged API fixture version 1. Issue #606 remains
open and PR #1046 remains draft/unmerged. Product query/authorization/paging
remediation is outside this CI-only slice; neither budgets nor scenarios are
exempted to suppress the failures.

PostgreSQL 18 evidence on candidate `86aaf5a5b0fcd43b54a97e3c3b78562d3e83ce72`
confirmed the following median command counts for first-page requests:

| Scenario | Small, page 5 | Medium, page 5 | Medium, page 10 | Confirmed failure |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Project list | 36 | 44 | 84 | Application paging, query growth/hard ceiling |
| Task list | 1,452 | 6,252 | 6,252 | Full-project materialization, cardinality growth |
| Conversation list | 50 | 79 | 119 | Cardinality/page-size growth, hard ceiling |
| Notification list | 4 | 9 | 9 | Oversized candidate materialization, cardinality growth |
| Announcement list | 11 | 11 | 16 | Page-size query growth |

Workspace, My Tasks, Files and Message list scenarios passed the structural
checks. Both collectors completed with fixture version 2. These observations
are regression evidence, not approved duration baselines or budget relaxations.

## Validation

The DB opt-in selects fixture version 2, supplying Workspace-owned Attachment rows for the Files API
and distinct deterministic Message cursor timestamps after EF's creation-time
stamping. The version participates in the fixture hash; version-1 baselines
are incompatible with DB evidence. The base PERF-02/API fixture retains
version 1 and its established hash when DB capture is disabled. The host creates the capture directory before starting the
app container so the collector can remove its evidence files.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/ci -p 'test_performance_db.py'
dotnet test tests/Coglatas.Tests/Coglatas.Tests.csproj --configuration Release \
  --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~PerformanceDbCaptureTests'
```

The real Npgsql controlled-N+1 and batched-query test requires
`POSTGRES_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING`. Its local skip is not PostgreSQL evidence.
The dedicated `PostgreSQL structural performance` workflow executes the
Release backend against PostgreSQL 18, using PERF-02 health, target, migration,
fixture, warm-up, fingerprint and teardown guards. It uploads sanitized
per-scenario query evidence and blocking results; no product pagination code
is changed by this issue.
