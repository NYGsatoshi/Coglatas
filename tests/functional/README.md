# Functional Playwright architecture

This directory is the canonical home for **real user-journey Functional Playwright coverage** introduced by FCI-03 (#585). Existing `tests/ui/` coverage is intentionally not bulk-renamed; migration is incremental and an old test remains until an equivalent replacement is green.

## Directory ownership

New Functional specs use domain directories:

```text
tests/functional/
  fixtures/
  helpers/
  auth/
  workspace/
  project-task/
  files/
  messaging/
  notification/
  announcement/
  security-negative/
```

Directories are created when their first migrated/owned spec lands. Screenshot-only and static/mock UI regression remain outside this tree, normally in `tests/ui/`.

## Required metadata

Every Functional spec must call `functionalMetadata(...)` as Playwright test details. Metadata is not encoded only in the human title.

```ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import { functionalMetadata } from '../fixtures/functional-metadata.mjs';

test(
  'persists a task through reload',
  functionalMetadata({
    journeyId: 'FUNC-TASK-001',
    gates: ['functional-fast', 'functional-full'],
    domains: ['task'],
    priority: 'p0',
    backend: 'real',
    polarity: 'positive'
  }),
  async ({ page }) => {
    // Journey body.
  }
);
```

The metadata helper emits repository-owned Playwright tags:

- base: `@functional`
- gates: `@functional-fast`, `@functional-full`, `@functional-extended`, `@functional-release`
- priority: `@p0`, `@p1`
- domains: `@auth`, `@workspace`, `@task`, `@files`, `@messaging`, `@notification`, `@announcement`, `@audit`, `@security-negative`
- classification: `@real-backend` or `@mock-backend`; `@positive` or `@negative`
- authorization negative: `@negative-authz`
- release evidence: `@release-evidence`
- traceability: `@journey-FUNC-...`

Journey IDs come from the FCI-01 matrix. The validator intentionally checks the stable ID format rather than hard-coding a registry so FCI-01 and FCI-03 can merge independently.

## Stable selection

Use `scripts/ci/run-functional-playwright.mjs`; it builds exact tag-token grep from metadata and defaults to `@real-backend` so mocked core APIs are not counted as a required real Functional gate.

```bash
node scripts/ci/run-functional-playwright.mjs --gate functional-fast --priority p0
node scripts/ci/run-functional-playwright.mjs --gate functional-full --domain files
node scripts/ci/run-functional-playwright.mjs --journey FUNC-TASK-001 -- --list
node scripts/ci/run-functional-playwright.mjs --domain security-negative --negative-authz
```

`build-functional-grep.mjs` ANDs dimensions and ORs repeated/comma-separated values within one dimension. It matches exact tag tokens, not accidental title substrings.

The runner also exports its explicit gate selection to the owner process as
`COGLATAS_FUNCTIONAL_SELECTED_GATES`. This lets one canonical owner test keep a
bounded `functional-fast` path and add its `functional-full`/extended steps
without duplicating the stable journey ID. A direct journey invocation with no
gate selection exercises the complete owner path.

The Functional list reporter prints `test.step` entries. Owner steps should
include both the stable journey ID and a stable step ID so console failures
identify the broken segment without requiring a trace artifact.

## Backend classification

`backend: 'real'` means the journey reaches the real application HTTP surface and authoritative persisted state for the behavior under test. A test that intercepts or fabricates success for core auth/business API routes must use `backend: 'mock'` and cannot satisfy required real Functional coverage.

Focused mocks remain useful for UI behavior, but they are not substitutes for FCI real-stack journeys.

## Shared helpers

The shared layer is deliberately narrow:

- `helpers/auth.ts` — login/logout/current-session helpers
- `helpers/csrf.ts` — `/api/security/csrf-token` and CSRF-aware unsafe requests
- `helpers/navigation.ts` — canonical Workspace/Project/Task routes
- `fixtures/aliases.ts` — deterministic fixture alias resolution; no private DB backdoor
- `helpers/authoritative-state.ts` — bounded polling of authoritative state instead of arbitrary fixed sleeps
- `helpers/safe-response.ts` — bounded/redacted failure previews
- `helpers/redaction.mjs` — recursive secret/token/password/cookie/license redaction for diagnostic material

## Selector policy

Use selectors in this order:

1. accessible role/name/label
2. stable user-visible text when appropriate
3. intentional `data-testid` when the control is otherwise unstable
4. CSS/layout/internal component structure only as a last resort

## Prohibited patterns

Do not:

- mutate private DB state to bypass authorization or accelerate the journey;
- intercept a core API and fabricate a success response in a `backend: 'real'` test;
- use arbitrary `page.waitForTimeout(...)` as the normal synchronization strategy;
- couple Functional selectors to CSS layout or internal component structure when an accessible locator exists;
- add new real Functional coverage to `tests/ui/angular-smoke.spec.ts`.

## Migration policy

- No Big Bang rename of `tests/ui/`.
- Keep legacy coverage until an equivalent tagged replacement is green.
- After parity, choose one owner test and reduce duplicates to focused regression where useful.
- Screenshot regression stays focused and separate from real Functional journeys.
- FCI-02 owns deterministic full-stack provisioning/reset; helpers here consume that public/application surface rather than reimplementing it.
- FCI-08/09 own required PR/main/nightly workflow wiring and sharding.

## Self-tests

Run the architecture contracts without a browser:

```bash
node --test tests/functional/*.node-test.mjs
node --check scripts/ci/functional-tags.mjs
node --check scripts/ci/build-functional-grep.mjs
node --check scripts/ci/run-functional-playwright.mjs
```
