## Unsolicited contributions are not accepted

This repository is publicly visible but is not an open-source project.
Unsolicited pull requests, patches, copied implementations, and feature
submissions are not accepted.

Pull-request creation is intended to be restricted to collaborators explicitly
authorized by the repository owner. Authorization to open a pull request does
not itself authorize use of repository-owned code outside this repository.

## Project language

English is the sole canonical language for engineering and project collaboration
in this repository. Authorized contributions must use English for source
identifiers, code comments, docstrings, test names and descriptions, repository
and configuration documentation, new commit messages, branch names, issue and
pull-request titles/bodies, comments/reviews, and project metadata.

Do not create or maintain parallel Japanese documentation or bilingual
engineering records. Existing non-English engineering material is being migrated
under [LANG-01](https://github.com/NYGsatoshi/Coglatas/issues/965); follow the
[project language policy](docs/PROJECT_LANGUAGE.md) for translation, verification,
provenance, and preservation requirements. Language cleanup does not authorize
behavior changes, changes to issue/PR lifecycle state, or Git-history rewriting.

Intentional end-user localization, IME/Unicode test fixtures, and exact attributed
source evidence have narrow preservation exceptions. Localized product content
must remain in the language required by the product. These exceptions do not
permit non-English engineering prose or public disclosure of private material.

## Authorized collaborators

Before submitting code, an authorized collaborator must:

1. have a separate written contribution agreement or other explicit permission
   from the repository owner;
2. confirm that the contribution is their original work or that every included
   third-party component may legally be submitted under the agreed terms;
3. avoid including credentials, private keys, personal data, school-internal
   data, production identifiers, or proprietary vendor material; and
4. accept that the repository owner may close or reject any pull request.

The repository owner may require changes, additional review, or legal clearance
before merge. No contribution is accepted merely because it was submitted,
reviewed, or technically mergeable.

## Security reports

Do not disclose suspected vulnerabilities in public issues or pull requests.
Follow [.github/SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md).
